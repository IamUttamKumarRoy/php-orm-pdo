*I had to make a simple application but I didnt find good options of simple ORM for PHP, that's why I made this basic classes.* Ps.: It's under development yet.

Let's get started:

  - CRUD functions
  - Auto load Model classes in Controllers
  - To use the automatic functions you should use the filename and structure conventions
  - Just follow the exemple on /controller/UsuariosController.php
  - All controllers in /controllers folder
  - All models in /models folder

So you have two options: you can use like a framework puting your files inside the folder structure or just use like a vendor and extending /controller/Controller.php into your controllers classes.
